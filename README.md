# Ten Simple Rules for Staying Safe Online

## Introduction

## Rule 1: Use realistic threat models.

-   You can't protect yourself from serious professionals, but most of us aren't their targets
-   Hollywood depictions of real threats are as far from reality as their portrayals of scientists
-   **Monica** (professor in psychology) vs. **Mohan** (undergraduate in computer science)
    -   Mohan spends hours every day in online echo chambers complaining about how "SJW bullshit" is ruining tech
    -   *Really* didn't enjoy Monica's guest lecture on discrimination and inclusivity in his software engineering class
    -   Thinks it would be a laugh to make the target of anonymous abuse online
    -   A *casual threat* potentially backed up by knowledgeable advisors
-   **Elena** vs. **Eric** (graduate students at the same university but not in the same department)
    -   Their relationship had become increasingly abusive over the last two years
    -   With the help of friends, Elena has moved out of their shared apartment and is rebuilding her life
    -   Eric is obsessed with the idea that she left him for someone else and is now stalking her
    -   An *intimate threat* who may know passwords and may have installed spyware on devices
-   **Boris** (professor of medicine) vs. **Bethany** (university IT staff)
    -   Boris has agreed to serve as an expert witness for a large chemical company in an upcoming liability trial
    -   Bethany has been asked by friends to find out what he is going to say in order to discredit his testimony
    -   An *insider threat*: Bethany may have legitimate access to some of Boris's accounts and devices

## Rule 2: You have to put on the condom yourself.

-   Safety comes from habits, not technology
-   At an airport several years ago listening to a professor of computer science try to re-set an online account over the phone
    -   Full name, address, date of birth, and what was almost certainly their mother's maiden name…
    -   …all loudly enough to be heard by two dozen people
-   On that same trip, a stranger (also a computer science professor) asked me to watch their laptop while they went to the washroom
    -   They were logged in to several online accounts at the time
-   Can't rely on companies to protect us
    -   As recently as ten years ago we could blame the lack of legal liability for data breaches on the law being slow to catch up
    -   Today, it's clear that the law hasn't caught up because large tech companies don't want it to
    -   Weekly reports of data breaches have minimal impact on profitability and no individual ever goes to jail
-   Much of what companies force us to go through online is actually counter-productive security theater
    -   "Counter-productive" because it encourages us to cut corners in ways that actually make us *less* safe

## Rule 3: Use a password manager.

-   Using a weak password is a good way to ensure that you're eventually going to have a bad day
    -   Offline dictionary attacks
-   Reusing passwords ensures that bad news spreads
-   But strong passwords are hard to remember and to type
    -   Prompts can often be harvested from social media profiles
-   Use a password manager
    -   Generates strong passwords
    -   Saves them all under a master pass phrase
    -   Creates a single point of attack
-   Writing passwords down and keeping them in your wallet is useful: at least you'll know if your written passwords go missing or get stolen

## Rule 4: Use two-factor authentication.

-   Authentication relies on something you *know*, something you *have*, or something you *are*
-   2FA relies on the first two
    -   Password plus a random code generated by a hardware device (or an app on your phone)
    -   Attackers need access to you
-   Random URLs via email do this as well: you *have* access to the email address
    -   But anyone who gains access to your email can then trigger a password reset cycle and steal your account

## Rule 5: Tighten your social media privacy settings.

-   Facebook, Twitter, and others make money selling targeted advertising to you and data about you
    -   Laws guaranteeing free speech don't actually require them to give a platform to hate speech
-   They have been forced to give users at least a little control over personal data, but frequently change their terms of service in opaque ways
-   Go through settings periodically and turn off almost everything
    -   As tedious and as necessary as cleaning leaves out of your gutters

## Rule 6: FIXME

## Rule 7: FIXME

## Rule 8: Erase, then discard.

-   Reporters and private investigators go dumpster diving regularly
-   Assume that any account you shut down or any device you throw away is going to fall into unfriendly hands
-   So erase data
    -   Practically impossible with social networking sites (though it should be required by law)
-   Moving files into the trash and then emptying it does *not* actually erase the data
    -   Just tells the computer that the space is available for re-use
-   Use a secure deletion tool (e.g., BleachBit on Linux or Windows)
-   But actually very hard on solid-state drives (SSDs)
    -   And none of this affects backups, files stored online (e.g., Dropbox)
-   Best answer is to encrypt the drive in the first place

## Rule 9: Encrypt your drives.

-   FIXME: explain drive encryption

## Rule 10: FIXME
