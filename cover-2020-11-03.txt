To whom it may concern,

We have revised our article "Ten Quick Tips for Staying Safe Online" as requested, and include a response to the reviewers below along with a PDF highlighting changes. We look forward to your response.

Thanks,
Danielle Smalls & Greg Wilson

- We agree with Reviewer #1 that these tips are generally applicable, though the threat models are not - we hope that researchers will use them in their personal lives as well as their professional work.

- Both of the stories in Rule 2 are accurate, but we have removed the second for length.

- We have not attempted to explain why researchers in some areas are now being targeted more frequently than before: there are many causes, which can vary widely from case to case, and we believe it may be years before we're able to untangle them objectively.

- Rules 2-9 are the "tangle actions that researchers can/should take to follow rule #1".

- We have included a link to Bruce Schneier's blog with (depressingly) many examples of security theater.

- We have recommended a secure file deletion tool for Mac OS and a password management tool for every platform.

- We have fixed typos and incorporated other minor changes (e.g., "romantic partner" is now "former romantic partner", made it clearer that "Boris" is a fictional character).
